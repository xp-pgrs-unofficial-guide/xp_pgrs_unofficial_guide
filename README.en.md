# Unofficial Guide for XJTLU PhD Students

üåê[‰∏≠ÊñáÁâà](README.md)

This guide was created to address many of the shortcomings of the official induction and, following the idea of "planting trees so that future generations may enjoy the shade," to offer advice for upcoming PhD students.

The project was originally initiated by the XJTLU PRG Society and is now managed by volunteer editors. Feel free to check it out and download it ([Download Link](https://github.com/xp-pgrs-unofficial-guide/xp_pgrs_unofficial_guide/releases/latest)).

If this project has helped you, please consider giving it a thumbs up (click the star) in the upper right corner.

This project is for the Chinese version. We have also set up an [English version project](https://github.com/xp-pgrs-unofficial-guide/xp_pgrs_unofficial_guide_EN).

## How to Contribute

If you‚Äôve gained valuable experience during your PhD‚Äîsuch as overcoming obstacles or discovering resources that might benefit other students‚Äîyou‚Äôre welcome to write a guide to help your juniors. Here‚Äôs how you can contribute:
- **Send your draft:** Whether it's in txt, tex, or Word format, you can email your draft to the project administrator (shiyao.zhang14@student) or paste/upload it directly on the discussion or issue page. The project administrator will handle the organization.
- **Submit a PR:** Create your own folder under the `author-folder`, add a new tex file inside, and start the file with a `\section` command. Then, find the appropriate chapter in the `chapters` directory and insert your guide using the `\input` command.
